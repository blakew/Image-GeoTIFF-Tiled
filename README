Image-GeoTIFF-Tiled version 0.01
======================================

A Perl interface to libgeotiff for tiled geoTIFF images, with support 
for extracting and iterating arbitrary shapes.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

The links to libtiff and libgeotiff were configured on my machine (Ubuntu
9.04) and probably need to be modified if they're not located along a standard
search path. Windows installations will probably have problems too - I would
appreciate any assistance in improving the Makefile configuration.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  libtiff
  libgeotiff

  Module::Load
  List::MoreUtils
